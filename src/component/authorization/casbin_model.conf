; -------------------------------------------------------------------
; ReBAC-style model for CalDAV/CardDAV with:
; - Direct sharing to users, groups, and "public"
; - Flat groups only (users belong to groups; groups are NOT nested)
; - Container membership (events in calendars, vcards in addressbooks)
; - Type-based permissions (policies written per resource type)
;
; NOTE ON GROUPS + PUBLIC:
; This model keeps the matcher simple and does NOT traverse user->group
; membership inside the matcher. Instead, your application should expand
; the effective subjects at enforcement time:
;
;   effective_subjects(user) = { user } ∪ groups(user) ∪ { public }
;
; and allow if ANY subject in that set is allowed by Enforce().
;
; Example enforcement for user:alice:
;   Enforce("user:alice", obj, act)
;   Enforce("group:eng",  obj, act)   ; for each group alice is in
;   Enforce("public",     obj, act)   ; public grants (if any)
;
; This avoids custom functions and works well for flat groups.
